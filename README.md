## Description

Duration: 2 Week Sprint

More than a Suit is a form filling and scheduling app created for the non-profit organization, Suits for Hire. The app helps gentlemen in need of suits find the appropriate attire for various occasions such as job interviews, funerals and court. Additional resources are provided on the app for the gentlemen; resources such as job skill training, legal aid, mental health and etc. The Kansas City Metro is the target community of the app and allows gentlemen to readily access the Suit for Hire calendar to schedule fittings.

The administration side of the app allows the administrator from Suit for Hire to edit resources, view scheduled fittings and to download appointment data in a csv file. All appointments past current date is automatically archived in the database while current schedules are displayed to ensure the most up to date schedule for the administer.
